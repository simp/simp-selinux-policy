# simp-environment-skeleton

This repositority contains items that [SIMP](https://simp-project.com) expects
to be in every [Puppet](https://puppet.com) environment.

It is a great starting place for creating Puppet Control Repos and is the
default environment that is used when running a regular
[SIMP](https://simp-project.com) system.
